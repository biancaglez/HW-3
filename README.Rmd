You are currently in the GitHub repository (repo) for `HW-3`. You must have
completed all the steps in [Setting 
Up](https://rudeboybert.github.io/MATH216/jekyll/update/2016/09/12/getting-started.html).





## Learning Goals

* Using the insight you garned from your Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in 
HW-2, you will now fit a logistic regression model to predict users' sex.
* Understanding what **out-of-sample** prediction is. For more info, try reading
Chapter 5.1 and 5.1.1 on pages 176-178 of [An Introduction to Statistical
Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)
* Working with dates and times.




## Homework

1. Follow the same workflow as in <a target="_blank" class="page-link"
href="https://github.com/2016-09-Middlebury-Data-Science/HW-0#homework">HW-0</a>
for HW-3.
1. Do not submit a `HW-3.Rmd` file that does not knit.
1. I anticipate you spending between 8-12 total (across all submissions) on this 
homework.





## Data

1. The same `profiles.csv` data from `HW-2`
1. `reed_jukebox.csv`: All songs played on the Reed College jukebox located in the pool room of the Commons building between November 30th, 2003 and January 22nd, 2009. The data was generously provided by Noah Pepper.
